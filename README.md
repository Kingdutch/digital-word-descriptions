A homebrewed digital version of the 30 Seconds Boardgame.

# Usage

# Disclaimer

This code was written in a rush. It is by no means an example of how to write a proper ReactJS application. 
This can be seen by the lack of comments, the way state is handled and how input handling is part of the
component instead of separated from the UI.
